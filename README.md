At the shopping cart problem I created a global array that was going to keep the elements we would add/remove from the cart. At the test cases I added 2 of the same objects in the array {name:"apple", price:5}, then confirmed
that the elemnts were added by expecting the size of the array to be 2, then used the test case to calculate the total of the total price of all the elemnts in the array (5+5=10) expect to get a 10, then  we remove one of the 
objects and test the size of the array again.
